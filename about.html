<div class="container about text">
<p> I was working as a freelance designer in Stockholm, but always wanted to work with IKEA. I took courses for a year and then got an internship with IKEA. I wanted to be in Älmhult where it all started. For a year now I’ve been working at the IKEA store in Älmhult.</p>
<br>
<p> I love building up a space. Trying to imagine the people who live there and what they want. Creating a story. That’s really interesting. I’m pretty new, but I really feel like people give you the chance to think outside the box all the time. That keeps my creative fantasy. At the same time, I need to show stuff that sells. It’s a lot about philosophy in some way. About people.</p>
<br>
<p>Working with IKEA has been in my head since I was small. As a child going to IKEA was so exciting. I kept track of all the collections. IKEA was a big thing for me. We have a design language. I love to see it transforming every year into new things. It’s really exciting to be part of it. Plus, we are lot of cultures, bringing different ideas and endless opportunities. </p>
